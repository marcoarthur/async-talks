# Asynchronous programming

This is a small article discussing some techniques I found useful when
programming asynchronously.

# How to compile

This uses pandoc for document building. If you have the necessary dependencies
you can build an html or pdf version of the article with:

```bash
make # doc.hmtl
make doc.pdf # for doc.pdf
```

Feel free to send me suggestion or better yet pull requests. The information
there can be mostly found on the bibliography notes.
